# React-based Google Books Search app

### Overview

 Created with React components, helper/util functions, and utilizes React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

 ## User Story
 As a user I want to search for a book, recieve the following information:
* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

* `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

I also want to save certain books to come back to later.

 ## Installation
